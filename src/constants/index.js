export const ABOUT_TEXT = `I am an aspiring Full Stack Developer with a strong foundation in JavaScript, Node.js, Express.js, React, and DevOps practices. I am eager to contribute my skills in building scalable web applications, deploying cloud-native solutions, and integrating modern development practices. With a passion for continuous learning, I explore technologies like Docker, Nginx, AWS, and Linux to strengthen my backend and deployment expertise.
My journey reflects a balance between software development and system-level programming, giving me a versatile skill set to tackle diverse challenges. I thrive in problem-solving environments and enjoy collaborating on impactful projects that bring real-world value.

Alongside my web development journey, I also have hands-on experience in Embedded Systems:

Worked with Arduino, STM32, Raspberry Pi Pico, Vega, and Aries microcontrollers.

Built practical projects such as a Smart Energy Meter and a Smart Irrigation System.

Familiar with C programming, hardware integration, and signal processing techniques.
